			<description><![CDATA[<p>"<i>Joomla is complicated</i>", "<i>Joomla is for tech guys</i>", "<i>Joomla isn't user friendly</i>". These are just a few of the most common (unfair) critics - or rather: assumptions - I've read about this awesome CMS.</p>
<p>In fact, Joomla is exactly like any other CMS or topic: cooking, astrophysic, woodcraft, scuba diving, etc. It's complicated if you don't take time to learn and to train about a minimum.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Every day, we send and receive emails, and often, these contain important information that we want delivered securely and for the intended recipient's eyes only. When important things end up in the spam folder, it is a pain… but this is an inconvenience that you can address with a degree of success.Since we are bombarded with fake emails, spam and spoofs trying to trick and do us harm, fighting spam is necessary. If you send emails, there’s a number of tools you can (or should) use to not be classified as spam and show you’re legit: SPF, DKIM and DMARC. </p>

			<title>Don’t You Forget About Me - How CRON changed my working week</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>As a young IT manager, sometime at the end of the last century, I came across a term that interested me a lot. It was “set it, and forget it”. Sounds a bit haphazard, doesn’t it? Apparently it was less to do with software than rotisserie chicken cooking. You'll find it on Google. Why would I want to forget something important? Well, semantics aside, the principle meant that I could go off and do other things rather than waiting to make sure my backups had run. </p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The Pizza bugs and Fun event in February 2024 is over, Pizza is eaten and most likely digested, but Bugs and Fun persist. You might have caught the bug testing and enjoy the feeling of marking a test as successful. When one of your tests is crucial for the merging of a PR or prevents a catastrophe - how cool is that? <br />However, as a non-developer, you might not know how to continue the PR testing on your own, so here are some hints.</p>
